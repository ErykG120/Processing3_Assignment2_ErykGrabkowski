 - Description Of Animation: Flappy Bird made in Processing3.
 
**Known Bugs/Problems:**  
 1. When "speed" is set to 3, it adds a point to the first pipe, skips
    the second pipe, and works normally from there on, this doesn't
    occur with any other speed value that is set.
 2. If you don't put in a number in the feedback survey, it will crash.
 3. There is a few second delay when loading the animation due to the
    sound library.
